    <h1>🧠 Mastering Conflict the Smart Way</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>A Real-Life Guide to the Thomas-Kilmann Model</strong></p>
      <blockquote>“Conflict is inevitable—but how we handle it defines who we are.”</blockquote>
      <p>We’ve all been there—awkward silence after an argument with a loved one, tension in a team meeting, or that nagging feeling that we should’ve said something but didn’t.</p>
      <p>What if I told you there’s a framework that can guide you through every kind of conflict—from those little daily frictions to the big emotional blowouts?</p>
      <p>That’s what the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Resolution Model offers: a way to respond, not react. It helped me transform how I communicate—at work, at home, and even with myself.</p>
      <p>Let me walk you through it, not just with theory, but with moments from real life—my own and the kind we all experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌟 The 5 Conflict-Handling Styles</h2>
      <p>The Thomas-Kilmann model is based on two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assertiveness: How much you stand up for your own needs.</li>
        <li>Cooperativeness: How much you care about others’ needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Balancing these gives us five powerful ways to handle conflict.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Style 1 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="style-title"><span class="emoji">🏆</span>Competing</h3>
      <p><strong>Best when:</strong> The stakes are high and time is short.</p>
      <p>I remember once during a college tech fest, we were about to present our final prototype. Two of my teammates started arguing about changing a feature—just 30 minutes before demo time.</p>
      <p>I had to make a quick decision: we couldn’t risk breaking the system by tweaking it so close to showtime. I stepped in and said, “We go with what we have—this isn’t the moment to improvise.”</p>
      <div class="key-lesson">✅ Key lesson: Sometimes, you have to take charge. When safety, deadlines, or critical outcomes are at stake, don’t hesitate to be firm.</div>
      <div class="key-use">🔑 Use it when the goal matters more than harmony—but don’t overdo it.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Style 2 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="style-title"><span class="emoji">🤝</span>Collaborating – “Let’s win together”</h3>
      <p><strong>Best when:</strong> The issue matters deeply to both people.</p>
      <p>During the lockdown, my sister and I clashed over our shared room. I needed quiet for online classes; she wanted to record dance videos. We kept arguing—until we sat down and talked.</p>
      <p>We created a daily schedule, splitting the time: I got the mornings, she got afternoons. It worked.</p>
      <div class="key-lesson">✅ Key lesson: Collaboration means investing time to understand each other, not just win.</div>
      <div class="key-use">🔑 Use it when you truly want a win-win—and can afford the time and emotional effort.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Style 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="style-title"><span class="emoji">⚖️</span>Compromising – “Let’s split the difference”</h3>
      <p><strong>Best when:</strong> You need a quick, fair resolution.</p>
      <p>Last week, a friend and I planned to binge-watch something. I wanted a documentary, she wanted a rom-com. We watched one episode of each.</p>
      <div class="key-lesson">✅ Key lesson: Compromise is practical. It’s about fairness, not perfection.</div>
      <div class="key-use">🔑 Use it when time is limited or the stakes are moderate.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Style 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="style-title"><span class="emoji">🙈</span>Avoiding – “Let’s not deal with this now”</h3>
      <p><strong>Best when:</strong> The issue is small—or emotions are running too hot.</p>
      <p>I once overheard a colleague at work blaming me for something I hadn’t done. I waited until the next day when we both were calm. I brought it up gently—it turned out to be a misunderstanding.</p>
      <div class="key-lesson">✅ Key lesson: Sometimes, silence buys you clarity.</div>
      <div class="key-use">🔑 Use it when the issue isn’t urgent or when immediate confrontation would escalate things.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Style 5 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h3 class="style-title"><span class="emoji">❤️</span>Accommodating – “You matter more right now”</h3>
      <p><strong>Best when:</strong> The relationship is more important than the disagreement.</p>
      <p>My little cousin wanted to show me his Minecraft world, but I was tired. I still said, “Alright, 15 minutes.” It meant the world to him—and to me later.</p>
      <div class="key-lesson">✅ Key lesson: Giving in can be powerful—when it’s your choice, not your weakness.</div>
      <div class="key-use">🔑 Use it when the issue isn’t a big deal to you, but it matters to someone else.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Application -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🔁 How to Apply This in Real Life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>✅ Pause & assess:</strong> What matters more? The relationship, the outcome, or your need to be right?</li>
        <li><strong>✅ Stay self-aware:</strong> Is your emotion driving your reaction? Breathe.</li>
        <li><strong>✅ Pick your response:</strong> Each style has a time and place. Be flexible, not fixed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Final thoughts -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌱 Conflict Isn’t the Enemy—It’s a Door to Connection</h2>
      <p>We often fear conflict. But here’s the truth: when handled well, conflict doesn’t destroy relationships—it strengthens them.</p>
      <p>The Thomas-Kilmann model helped me move from reacting out of habit to responding with awareness.</p>
      <p>So next time you’re in a disagreement, ask yourself:</p>
      <blockquote>“What does this moment need from me?”</blockquote>
      <p>A firm decision? A warm compromise? Or just some silence?</p>
      <p><strong>Choose wisely. Grow daily. You’ve got this.</strong></p>
